Welcome to the GPT-4o Semantic Kernel sample using C#. This repository contains a demo project that showcases how to integrate the powerful GPT-4o model with the Semantic Kernel in a .NET environment.

## Prerequisites

Before running the sample, ensure you have the following installed:
- **.NET 8**: Make sure you have the latest version of .NET installed on your machine.
- **OpenAI Key**: An OpenAI API key is required to authenticate and interact with the GPT-4o model.
- **(Optional) Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code**: You will need an IDE or code editor capable of running .NET projects. Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code are recommended.

## About the Sample

This sample demonstrates the capabilities of the GPT-4o model by analyzing and describing an image. It utilizes the Semantic Kernel to process the image and generate a description using C#.

## How to Run the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
1. Open a terminal and enter your OpenAI Key with the following commands 
    ```bash
    cd .\src\
    dotnet user-secrets init
    dotnet user-secrets set "APIKEY" "OpenAI API KEY"
    ```

1. Run the project with the command
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

1.  The current project analyzes this image

    ![Ultra running mug](/imgs/ultrarunningmug.png)

1. You should see an output similar to this one:

    *The image shows a person holding a mug that has the text "Ultrarunning (verb) the art of running as far as you can, and then running another 20 miles." In the background, there is a scenic view of trees and lush greenery, along with an outdoor swimming pool surrounded by a paved deck with lounge chairs. Additionally, a dog is partially visible near the bottom right of the image, standing near the railing. The scene appears to be tranquil and picturesque, likely taking place in a backyard or a similar outdoor setting.*



## Use another image

In order to test the project with another image, edit the `program.cs` file.

In example, using this new image

![Bruno Standing in a podium](/imgs/rpi5.png)

And updating the code

```csharp
var collectionItems= new ChatMessageContentItemCollection
{
    new TextContent("What's in the image?"),
    new ImageContent(new Uri("https://github.com/elbruno/gpt4ol-sk-csharp/blob/main/imgs/rpi5.png?raw=true"))
};
history.AddUserMessage(collectionItems);
```

We get an output similar to this one:

    The image appears to be a screenshot of a terminal window running on a Raspberry Pi device. The user has executed the `neofetch` command with `sudo`, and the terminal displayed system information. Additionally, the `ollama list` command was executed, showing a list of local models.

    Here's the breakdown of the terminal output:

    ### System Information (Neofetch Output)
